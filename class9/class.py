"""
Create a countdown timer (in seconds) using a for loop.
- The user can enter a number of seconds.
- When the countdown reaches 0, display "Time's up!"

Example(in terminal):
---
Please enter the number of seconds: 3  
3  
2  
1  
Time's up! 

---

This way, the program will count down and show each second on the screen until it reaches zero.

Please enter the number of times you want to jump rope.
The student is jumping rope, and when they reach multiples of 10 (like 10, 20, 30â€¦), they take a break. Use `continue` to skip jumping when it is the 10th, 20th, 30th... time.

Example:
Please enter the number of times you want to jump rope: 15
Jump 1 time
Jump 2 times
Jump 3 times
Jump 4 times
Jump 5 times
Jump 6 times
Jump 7 times
Jump 8 times
